**Title:** Raspberry Pi-Controlled Car Wash Simulator with Real-Time Interaction

**Introduction:**
This project marks my debut in the realm of Raspberry Pi (RPI) and computer communication. It revolves around a user-controlled miniature car wash machine, implemented as a Windows Form App-based model. The real-world simulation involves using sensors to detect the car's position throughout its various stages.

**Description:**
The miniature car wash machine is a scale model project, providing user-controlled functionalities. Employing various sensors, I monitor the car's progression through distinct phases. Leveraging TCP-UDP communication between Raspberry Pi and a Windows Form App interface, I send signals to the computer, enabling control over the barrier speed and adjusting the water tank and fan at variable speeds, all in a sequential manner.

**Key Features:**

**Real-Time Interaction:** The project ensures real-time interaction between the user and the miniature car wash, allowing dynamic control over its components.

**Sensor Integration:** Utilizing sensors, the system accurately detects the car's position, facilitating responsive actions.

**TCP-UDP Communication:** Raspberry Pi communicates with the Windows Form App through TCP-UDP, enabling seamless data exchange.

**Sequential Control:** The user can efficiently manage the barrier speed, water tank angle, and fan speed in a sequential order.

**Implementation:**
The project is implemented using Raspberry Pi as the brain of the system, sensors for real-time feedback, and a Windows Form App to provide a user-friendly interface. The TCP-UDP communication protocol ensures reliable data transfer between the Raspberry Pi and the Windows Form App.

**Conclusion:**
This project showcases my initial venture into the world of Raspberry Pi and demonstrates my ability to integrate hardware, software, and real-world simulation. The miniature car wash model serves as a tangible representation of my skills in sensor integration, communication protocols, and sequential control systems.
